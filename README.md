# Diary.jl ðŸ“”

`Diary.jl` keeps a copy of what you type in the REPL in a `diary.jl` file in the root of your current active environment.  It helps you sketch out ideas in the REPL, which can then later be refined, by editing and copying relevant pieces from `diary.jl`.

Note: `Diary.jl` is still under development, but feedback is much appreciated.

## Usage

To try out `Diary.jl`, install it using `]add https://github.com/dalum/Diary.jl`. Then,
```julia
julia> using Diary

julia> Diary.enable()
```
to get started.

If you want to enable `Diary.jl` by default, put the following in your `~/.julia/config/startup.jl` file:
```julia
try
    using Diary
    Diary.config(author_name="<your name>")
    Diary.enable()
catch e
    @warn(e.msg)
end
```
