It works by monitoring changes to your REPL history, and automatically placing lines that parse as valid Julia syntax into a diary.jl file in your current active project.  To prevent accidental cluttering, however, this is not done for the default ~/.julia/environments/vX.Y/ environments.","category":"page"},{"location":"introduction/","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Diary.jl also keeps track of when you change your active project, and automatically switches to the associated diary file.  By default, the diary file is called diary.jl, but this can be changed by calling Diary.configure(diary_file_name=\"<name>\").  Both of these behaviours are overridden if the environment variable, JULIA_DIARY, is set.  JULIA_DIARY specifies the desired location and name of the diary file for the session and can be changed at any time by setting ENV[\"JULIA_DIARY\"] = \"path/to/file\".  To disable it, remove the environment variable by calling: delete!(ENV, \"JULIA_DIARY\").","category":"page"},{"location":"developer_reference/#Developer-reference","page":"Developer reference","title":"Developer reference","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"developer_reference/","page":"Developer reference","title":"Developer reference","text":"start_watching\nwatch_task\nfind_diary\nparse_history\nwrite_header\nDiaryConfig\nTaskThunk","category":"page"},{"location":"#Diary.jl","page":"Index","title":"Diary.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Index","title":"Index","text":"Welcome to the documentation for Diary.jl!","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Index","title":"Index","text":"This document is intended to help you get started with using the package.
