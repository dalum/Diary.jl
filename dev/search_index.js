It works by monitoring changes to your REPL history, and automatically placing lines that parse as valid Julia syntax into a diary.jl file in your current active project.

By default, the diary file is called diary.jl, but this can be changed by calling Diary.configure(diary_file_name=\"<name>\").  Both of these behaviours are overridden if the environment variable, JULIA_DIARY, is set.  JULIA_DIARY specifies the desired location and name of the diary file for the session and can be changed at any time by setting ENV[\"JULIA_DIARY\"] = \"path/to/file\".
